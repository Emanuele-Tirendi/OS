<h1>Chess Opening Lesson</h1>
<p>This site is dedicated to give the reader a very small Lesson about the Vienna-Opening.<br>
  And leave some space for Readers to share their own lines as well as Tips and tricks to the Gambit. <br>
  The Lists on this site are here for people to share their own lines and add the knowledge. <br>
  We dearly hope that all our friends of the board game can learn and or contribute to this site with their own knowledge.</p>
<h1>The Vienna Opening</h1>
<p> There are two Versions of the Vienna-Opening namely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Vienna Gambit</li>
    <li>The Vienne Game</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Vienna Gambit:</h2>
<p>The Vienna Gambit starts with the moves: e4, e5 followed by the moves kc3, kf6</p>

<p>Typically white plays the next move pawn to f4 attacking the black pawn on e5.</p>
<p>Black can respond with a series of possible moves. Possible lines are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nxe4, taking the pawn and attacking the night on c3</li>
    <li>exf4, capturing the pawn with another pawn and therefore accepting the gambit.</li>
    <li>d6, defending the pawn in the centre</li>
    <li>d5, attacking the pawn on e4 (which is considered the main line)</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Vienna Game</h2>
<p>The Vienne Game starts with the moves:</p>
<p>It starts with e4, e5, Nc3, Nc6</p>
<p>From here a series of moves can be played from white. I personally recommend Bc4 but many other moves are fine.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bc4, developping the bishop by bringing it to the middle of the board.</li>
</ul>
